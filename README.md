# Coevolution_Vs_Crossover

Recent research has examined situations where genetic algorithms with crossover gives demonstrable advantage over genetic algorithms without crossover. This works aims to re-implement one such example and reformulate the problem to one of a coevolutionary flavour and demonstrate that through problem decomposition, coevolutionary solutions using mutation only can be competitive with genetic algorithms with crossover.
